# Formify-API-Integration-and-Front-End-Interaction

# Full Stack Development Project

This project is a web application demonstrating full-stack development concepts, including server-side rendering, form validation, dynamic DOM manipulation, and API integration. It features a form submission system with CRUD operations and a responsive UI.

## Features

- **HTML Structure & Basic Server Interaction**: An HTML form for user input, a basic Node.js server with Express, and server-side rendering using EJS.
- **Inline Styles & Basic Interaction**: Enhanced HTML forms with inline JavaScript for client-side validation and server-side validation with temporary in-memory storage.
- **Advanced CSS Styling & Responsive Design**: A complex layout with advanced CSS styling and responsive design using Bootstrap.
- **Complex Form Validation & Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Advanced form validation rules, dynamic updates to the DOM, and client-side routing.
- **API Integration & Front-End Interaction**: RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations, with front-end interaction for fetching and displaying data.
